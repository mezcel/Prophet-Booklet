# Prophet-Booklet

## page curl, page turn, text reader

It works, but its nowhere near a demo yet.

You must unzip to extracct turn.js version 3 (turn.min.js)[https://github.com/mezcel/Prophet-Booklet/blob/master/turn.js-master.zip]

Right now I am using turn.js version 3 for the test bench, but hope to finalize with turn.js Version 4.
Version 4 looks prettier

There is not a lot going on here. I am mearley applying turn.js with text content featuring prophets of the Christian Bible.

I hope to expand it the expand on the primary prohets featued in Islam aswell. In oder to list positive similariteis and constructive difference on the faith traditions.
