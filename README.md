### Status

Demo Video: [YouTube Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX64A10HAQc)

It works, but its nowhere near a demo yet.

You must unzip to extracct turn.js version 3 [turn.min.js](https://github.com/mezcel/Prophet-Booklet/blob/master/turn.js-master.zip)

Right now I am using turn.js version 3 for the test bench, but hope to finalize with turn.js Version 4.

Version 4 looks prettier [web](http://www.turnjs.com/)
